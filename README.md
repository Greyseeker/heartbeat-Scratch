Heartbeat made on Scratch

Just a basic scratch program, I made in a couple of hours.

Keep the heart beating by clicking it every 5 beats. Your patient dies if you get distrcted and do not keep it going.

Need to fix if possible on scratch, is click spamming. Although you don't score if you do this, I would like it to so you do score. 

Works on Scratch @ https://scratch.mit.edu/.
